    <h1>Emily Bertelson</h1>
    <p>Hello!</p>
    <p>
        I'm a student at the University of Colorado at Boulder, on track to obtain a B.S. in Computer Science in the spring of 2015. My interests outside
        of technology (though they occasionally intersect with it) include visual
        art, crafts, and zoology.
    </p>
    <p>
        I hope to come up with some more content to put here one of these days... but here's what we have so far:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="art">Art portfolio</a><br>
                 Static HTML site built for a college application in 2011.
                Bear in mind that it hasn't been touched since then.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="startupideamachine">Tech startup idea machine</a><br>
                 Goofy little random idea generator.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="gimp">Design analysis of GIMP 2.8</a><br>
                 Something for a writing class.
        </li>
    </ul>
